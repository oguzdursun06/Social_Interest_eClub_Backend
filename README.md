# Social_Interest_eClub_Backend
Social Interest eClub (SIeC) Project using Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, PostgreSQL with Maven - 2021

I used Java 14 and Intellij IDEA while developing for this project. I used PostgreSQL for the database and I also used Postman to test the api examples. Be careful, there may be problems with version differences. 

You can also access the web application of this project from my github repositories.


### How to build a project

1. Clone/ download this github repository.
2. Extract it on your local machine.
3. Import backend folder in IntelliJ IDEA as a maven project.
4. Write your PostgreSQL username and password in src -> main -> resources -> application.properties.
5. Run application.
